# Changelog

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/dhensby/readable-tokens/compare/v0.3.0...v1.0.0) (2023-08-07)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* This refactors the encoders/validators to be classes which are instantiated and
used.

The Base62Encoder is replaced with a generic `BaseXEncoder` which allows consumers to provider
their own alphabets, if needed.

This change means the exports of the library have changed and so this is a breaking change for
those that relied on some of those exports.
